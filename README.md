# Knot  ðŸª¢

**Knot** is a framework that *ties the gap* between Playwright and canvas-based testing.

Traditional Playwright selectors donâ€™t work on canvas elements, since its content is rendered pixel-by-pixel.<br>
Knot overcomes this limitation by combining Playwright's browser automation with OpenCV for image-based recognition. This allows automated tests to detect and interact with visual elements drawn on the canvas using reference image templates.

The project includes a sample test implementation demonstrating how to use Knot to validate canvas content and simulate real user interactions.


## Getting Started
